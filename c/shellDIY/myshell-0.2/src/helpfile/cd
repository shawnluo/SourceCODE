cd: cd [-L|-P] [dir]
    Change the current directory to DIR.  The variable $HOME is the
    default DIR.  The variable CDPATH defines the search path for
    the directory containing DIR.  Alternative directory names in CDPATH
    are separated by a colon (:).  A null directory name is the same as
    the current directory, i.e. `.'.  If DIR begins with a slash (/),
    then CDPATH is not used.  If the directory is not found, and the
    shell option `cdable_vars' is set, then try the word as a variable
    name.  If that variable has a value, then cd to the value of that
    variable.  The -P option says to use the physical directory structure
    instead of following symbolic links; the -L option forces symbolic links
    to be followed.
