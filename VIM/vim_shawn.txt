1. copy/delete word under cursor in Vim
    yw / byw

    Assuming that the cursor is at the first character of the word simply do this in command mode:
        yw
    y is for yank and w is for word.

    Other ways of doing the same thing which are not as efficient:
        vey
    the v starts visual select mode. e tells vim to move to end of word. y yanks or copies the word. to delete replace y with x.

    if the cursor is somewhere in the middle of the word, add a b before the command as in:
        byw
    or
        bvey
